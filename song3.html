  Get it<br>
  Text message I don't know the number<br>
  Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle<br>
  Steady taking shots, but I'm never hurting nothing<br>
  Even then you don't worry none<br>
  And I'd like to give a shoutout to my niggas with the game plan<br>
  And shoutout to my niggas with escape plans<br>
  Twenty bands, rain dance<br>
  We can keep the rain check or we can make plans<br>
  Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay lets rock and roll this<br>
  Time to go, lock stock and two smoking barrels<br>
  Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em<br>
  You think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open<br>
  Line around the corner line 'em up to block it over<br>
  Times I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus<br>
  My shades Dior, my pants velour<br>
  Create, explore, expand, conquer</p>
  <p>
  I came, I saw<br>
  I came, I saw<br>
  I praise the Lord, then break the law<br>
  I take what's mine, then take some more<br>
  It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours<br>
  I came, I saw<br>
  I came, I saw<br>
  I praise the Lord, then break the law<br>
  I take what's mine, then take some more<br>
  It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours</p>
  <p>
  Yeah<br>
  I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (yeah)<br>
  I listened to X, I'm peak, the bars (yeah)<br>
  The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs<br>
  The games, attract, protect, your heart (yeah)<br>
  I waited in line, return, refine<br>
  The new design, it's time to shine (wo)<br>
  To shine (wo), to shine (wo), to shine (wo), to shine<br>
  I hustle, I flex, the world is mine<br>
  So please believe, allow the greaze<br>
  These niggas disease, don't speak we squeeze (squeeze)<br>
  I make the devil go weak the knees<br>
  You hate, you're lame, your loss</p>
  <p>
  I came, I saw<br>
  I came, I saw<br>
  I praise the Lord, then break the law<br>
  I take what's mine, then take some more<br>
  It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours<br>
  I came, I saw<br>
  I came, I saw<br>
  I praise the Lord, then break the law<br>
  I take what's mine, then take some more<br>
  It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours</p>
  <p>
  She came, I came now whats my name<br>
  My chain (wo), my pants (wo), my pants with the chain(wo wo wo)<br>
  They know its me (wo), the hat and the shades (wo wo wo wo)<br>
  They heard my voice and they ran to the stage (what!)<br>
  My vans, my braids (what!)<br>
  My mans, my babe (what!)<br>
